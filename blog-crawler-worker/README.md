# Voltade Blog Crawler - Automated Blog Publishing System

## üéØ What This Does

This system automatically finds new blog posts from Voltade's website and publishes them to the company blog with beautiful, branded images. It runs every day at 9 AM Singapore time without any manual work needed.

## üîÑ How It Works (Simple Overview)

1. **Finds New Content**: Every morning, the system checks Voltade's website for new blog posts
2. **Creates Beautiful Images**: Automatically generates branded images for each blog post using your uploaded graphics
3. **Publishes Everything**: Sends the blog post and image to your blog website automatically
4. **Keeps Track**: Remembers what it already published so it doesn't duplicate content

## üìä Current Status
